    <p>
      Arepas are a traditional Colombian dish made from ground cornmeal, water, and a pinch of salt, shaped into round patties and cooked on a griddle until golden. Soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside, arepas have been a staple food in Colombian homes for centuries. They are versatile and can be enjoyed plain with butter, filled with cheese, or split open and stuffed with meats, eggs, or vegetables. Their simplicity and adaptability have made them a cultural icon across Colombia.
